<P4><font size="10" face="Fantasy"> Growing up in the Ruthless Streets in Shafter, California these Gents decided to join Cross Country.

 Each with their unique stories, and nicknames. Each following the Golden Rule, " TO HAVE FUN AND NOT CARE WHAT OTHERS THINK OF YOU." To some 

this was their second FAMILY in here everybody had each others backs. During lunch, they would fill up two tables. Their would be times when unknown

 people would sit at the table or put their stuff their and try to take the table. The  unknowns would lose since the JV FOR LIFE TEAM would sit and take up 

the rest of the space. Eventually, the invaders would get uncomftorable and leave. The unknowns would never sit their after the encounter .  Every now and then they are seen playing soccer at the Famous Shafter High 

Tennis Courts. They are also in touch even though some have already graduated. </P4>
